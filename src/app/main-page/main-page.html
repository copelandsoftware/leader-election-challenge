  Leader Election Challenge

@if (!collapsedTitle) {
  <p>The goal of this exercise is to implement a better leader election algorithm. The current algorithm works if nodes
    never go offline and the network is always reliable. This is never true in the real world, and can easily get into
    a broken state where the cluster runs forever and does not agree on a leader.

    <li>All online nodes eventually agree on a leader node</li>
    <li>If the leader goes offline, a new leader node is eventually elected</li>
    <li>During a network partition, a new leader is only elected if a majority of the total nodes agree</li>
    <li>When a network partition heals all nodes eventually agree on the leader again</li>
    <li>New nodes joining the cluster accept the current leader or trigger a leader election</li>

    <li>All code modifications should be isolated to the following:</li>
    <ol>
      <li>src/app/server-node Component</li>
      <li>src/app/message.ts MessageType and Message</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Nodes that are offline or on the other side of a partition are considered unreachable, and messages will not be delivered.</li>
    <li>There are 3 functions used for communication between nodes:</li>
    <ol>
      <li><b>broadcast</b> - this will attempt to send a message to all other nodes on the network. Unreachable nodes will not receive the message, but no failures will be returned.</li>
      <li><b>sendCast</b> - this will attempt to send a message to one node on the network. Unreachable nodes will not receive the message, but no failure will be returned.</li>
      <li><b>sendCall</b> - this will send a message to one node and wait for a response message to be returned. Unreachable nodes will not receive the message, and an error will be returned after the network delay.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>All messages sent have a randomized delay to simulate network latency (1-100ms)</li>
    <li>Due to the Angular component lifecycle, put initialization code in the server-node onInit() method.</li>
    <li>Feel free to remove or replace the call to generateSomeTraffic in the initialization of server-node, that code is there for example purposes and to show how the
      info variable can be used to display information
